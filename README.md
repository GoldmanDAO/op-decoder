# 🧙 Ethereum Bytecode Decoder 🔮

This tool 🛠️ is written in Rust and decodes Ethereum bytecode into human-readable opcodes and their operands. Ever felt like an ancient wizard trying to decipher an old scroll 📜? Worry not, this decoder is your magical monocle 🧐!

## ✨ What does it do?

- **Decodes**: Converts Ethereum bytecode (the enigmatic hex string 🧩) into a list of opcodes (instructions) and operands (data).

- **Stack**: It also keeps track of the stack state after each opcode (👷‍♂️ in progress)

- **More to come...**
